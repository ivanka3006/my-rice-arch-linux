NVIDIA:
Warning: Please ensure your graphics card is supported by modern NVIDIA driver before installing. For a list of supported GPUs click here: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/149138/en-us

Proprietary driver and support for Vulkan are required for proper functionality of games.

To install it, execute the following command:




sudo pacman -S --needed nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils nvidia-settings vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader




AMD
To install support for Vulkan API (will be functional only if you have a Vulkan capable GPU) and 32-bit games, execute following command:





sudo pacman -S --needed lib32-mesa vulkan-radeon lib32-vulkan-radeon vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader




Intel
To install support for Vulkan API (will be functional only if you have a Vulkan capable GPU) and 32-bit games, execute following command:





sudo pacman -S --needed lib32-mesa vulkan-intel lib32-vulkan-intel vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader




Note for Intel integrated graphics users: Only Skylake and newer Intel CPUs (processors) offer full Vulkan support. Broadwell, Haswell and Ivy Bridge only offer partial support, which will very likely not work with a lot of games properly. Sandy Bridge and older lack any Vulkan support whatsoever.
